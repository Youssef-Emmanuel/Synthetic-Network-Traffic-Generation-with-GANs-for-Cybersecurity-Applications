# Synthetic-Network-Traffic-Generation-with-GANs-for-Cybersecurity-Applications
Developed a PyTorch-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic synthetic network traffic using the CTU-IoT-Malware dataset. The project includes full preprocessing (IP decomposition, categorical encoding, and scaling), a custom-designed generator and discriminator with stable training techniques (label smoothing, noise injection, and weight initialization), and postprocessing to reconstruct readable traffic features. The final synthetic data mimics both benign and malicious patterns, supporting safe, large-scale testing of intrusion detection and network defense systems.
